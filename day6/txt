Difference between Type Coversion and Type Coercion - Type conversion is where you manually convert the datatype of a given value using functions like number(), string(), Boolean(). Javascript has in built feature of Type coercion
where the data type of a given value changes implicitly behind the scenes.

Truthy and Falsy values:
Values that get converted into false when boolean conversiob takes place are called as Falsy values. There are 5 such values in Javascript.
1. 0
2.''
3. Undefined
4. Nan
5. Null

Any number other than 0, any string other than empty string, all the values except the above 5 falsy values are truthy values

Strict and Loose Equality and inequality operators.
In strict euality operators and strict inequality operators "type coercion" does not take place
"===" "!=="

In Loose equality and inequality operators "type coercion" takes place.
"==" "!="
