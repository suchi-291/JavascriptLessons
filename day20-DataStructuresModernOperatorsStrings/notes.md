## Optional Chaining (?.)

- Optional chaining is a feature of Arrays and Objects

- When we use, If certain property of an object does not exist, then undefined will be outputted immediately.

**Note:** Like the nullish operator, the property is said to exist as long as it is neither null nor undefined

- We can have multiple optional chaining

- Both **Optional Chaining operator** and the **Nullish Coalesing Operator** work well together and were introduced in ES2020

- Optional Chaining works well for methods as well. i;e., We can check whether a method exists before we call it.

- It works on **Arrays** as well, it checks if an array is empty.
